}

You can use the file explorer from your operating system to navigate the user friendly directory structure of a YAML configuration, and you can use any standard text editor to view and edit the individual YAML files.

Ideally, a standard IDE can be used to create a project and edit the files of a YAML configuration. The externalized files for scripts, JSON, and so on allow you to edit these files in an editor that is syntax-aware.

## Edit a YAML configuration with ES Explorer

[ES Explorer](/docs/apigtw_devguide/entity_store#use-the-es-explorer) can be used with some limitations to view, navigate, and edit a YAML configuration. To connect to a YAML configuration, enter a URL of the form `yaml:file:/root/dir/of/yaml`.

## Add a new certificate and private key to a YAML configuration

This section covers the steps required to add a new certificate and private key to an existing YAML configuration.

1. You must have a certificate in a `PEM` file and its related private key in a separate `PEM` file. For example, `Axway-cert.pem` and `Axway-key.pem`. The private key cannot be encrypted with OpenSSL, as it is not supported.

2. For testing purposes, you can generate an unencrypted private key and a self-signed certificate PEM files using OpenSSL as follows:

    ```
    > openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout Axway-key.pem -out Axway-cert.pem
    Generating a RSA private key
    ................+++++
    ...............................................................................+++++
    writing new private key to 'Axway-key.pem'
    -----
    You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
    into your certificate request.
    What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
    There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
    For some fields there will be a default value,
    If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
    -----
    Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:IE
    State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Dublin
    Locality Name (eg, city) []:
    Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Axway
    Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
    Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:Axway
    Email Address []:axway@axway.com
    ```

3. Copy the `Axway-cert.pem` and `Axway-key.pem` files into the `/Environment Configuration/Certificate Store` directory in your YAML entity store.

4. Create the `/Environment Configuration/Certificate Store/Axway.yaml` file in your YAML entity store:

    ```yaml
    ---
    type: Certificate
    fields:
      dname: Axway
      key: '{{file "Axway-key.pem" "pem"}}'
      content: '{{file "Axway-cert.pem" "pem"}}'
    ```

    The `pem` option in `{{file}}` placeholder is mandatory when using a `PEM` file containing header and footer.

5. Edit another entity that requires a certificate and private key, for example, an `XML Signature filter` (see the `signingCert` field in the following example). It now points to the new certificate and private key via its YamlPK `/Environment Configuration/Certificate Store/Axway`.

    ```yaml
    ---
    type: FilterCircuit
    fields:
      name: cert
      start: ./XML Signature Generation
    children:
    - type: GenerateSignatureFilter
      fields:
        signingCertAttribute: ""
        keyWrapAlgorithm: http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#rsa-oaep-mgf1p
        symmetricKeyEncryptionCertAttribute: ""
        name: XML Signature Generation
        signingCert: /Environment Configuration/Certificate Store/Axway   # <-- certificate ref
        symmetricKeyAttribute: ""
        wsuIdElementSpecification:
        - /System/Element Specifiers/http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/,Body,1
        - /System/Element Specifiers/http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope,Body,1
        attachmentTransform: ""
      routing:
        success: ../XML Signature Verification
      logging:
        fatal: 'Error during message signing. Error: ${circuit.exception}'
        failure: Failed to sign message
        success: Signed message successfully
      children:
      - type: KeyInfoFormat
        fields:
          keyNameValue: CN
          publicKeyInfoMask: 15
          keyNameType: 2
          certAttachmentId: ""
    ```

If the YAML configuration you are adding the certificate and private key into is encrypted with a passphrase, you will need to encrypt the private key file. To encrypt the private key file `Axway-key.pem`, execute all the previous steps and also perform the following:

```shell
cd apigateway/posix/bin
./yamles encrypt --file ~/yaml/Environment\ Configuration/Certificate\ Store/Axway-key.pem --source /home/user/yaml --passphrase changeme
The file `/home/user/yaml/Environment Configuration/Certificate Store/Axway-key.pem` has been encrypted
```

* `yamles encrypt` with `--file` option only supports encryption of `PEM` file containing header and footer.

* The YAML configuration referenced in the `--source` parameter of the `encrypt` command must be the destination YAML configuration to ensure it is encrypted correctly.

* After you complete editing the YAML configuration, create a `.tar.gz` file and deploy it to your running API Gateway. Your API Gateway group must use the same encryption passphrase.

## Manually create an entity instance YAML file

To create an entity instance of [`NetService` type](/docs/apim_yamles/apim_yamles_references/yamles_types), perform the following:

1. Search for the `NetService.yaml` file within the `META-INF/types` directory.

    To know what fields can be used, move up to the ancestor types:

    * `NetService.yaml` is contained within `JavaProcess` directory. Check the fields within YAML entity type file `JavaProcess.yaml`.
    * `JavaProcess.yaml` is contained within `Process` directory. Check the fields within YAML entity type file `Process.yaml`.
    * Continue until you reach the root directory `Entity`.

2. Search for components.

    Use the same approach you have used to search for fields. `NetService` has two components: `LoadableModule` and `ClassLoader`. Search for `LoadableModule.yaml` and `ClassLoader.yaml` YAML files within the `META-INF/types` directory.
3. Execute all the previous steps again to get all required and optional fields for each entity type.

### Create a container entity

If the entity instance you have created is a [container entity](/docs/apim_yamles/yamles_structure#_parentyaml):

1. Create a new directory with the same name of the new entity instance.
2. Create a YAML file named `_parent.yaml`.
3. Add the YAML file to the newly created directory.

Example:

```yaml
---
type: NetService
fields:
  name: MyService
```

![new container entity](/Images/apim_yamles/yamles_new_container_entity.png)

### Create a non-container entity

If the entity instance you have created is not a container entity:

1. Create a YAML file named like the **name** field.
2. Add the YAM file to the correct directory.

Example:

```yaml
---
type: InetInterface
fields:
  port: 8080
  name: My Traffic HTTP Interface
```

![new entity](/Images/apim_yamles/yamles_new_entity.png)

Despite what is in the model, some fields that are said to be mandatory (cardinality=1 and no default value) are not mandatory. Required fields and default values can be checked in Policy Studio on an XML-based project by creating the same type of entity and observing what is allowed and created by default.

## YAML syntax considerations

When modifying your YAML configuration, consider the following:

### Strings fields

For strings literal we chose the "plain mode" of YAML as it is more readable, here are some caveat you want to avoid:

| Syntax                                 | Status    |
|----------------------------------------|-----------|
| `name: Foo`                            | OK        |
| `name: "Foo"`                          | OK        |
| `name: ${system.host}`                 | Error     |
| `name: "${system.host}"`               | OK        |
| `name: '${system.host}'`               | OK        |
| `name: "Please avoid trailing spaces "`| OK        |
| `name: " Please avoid leading spaces"` | OK        |
| `name:     So many whitespaces !`      | Warning   |

For the last case, leading and trailing spaces will be removed. The value will be "`So many whitespaces !`"

### int, long, and boolean fields

Quotation marks are not recommended for int, long, and boolean fields.

| Syntax                          | Status                      |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|`integerField: 0`                | OK                          |
|`integerField: -1`               | OK                          |
|`integerField: 9999999999999999` | Error (it a long)           |
|`integerField: 100_000`          | Error                       |
|`integerField: "1"`              | Avoid (though it will work) |
|`longField: 21546873548687`      | OK                          |
|`longField: 1_000_000_000_000`   | Error                       |
|`longField: "21546873548687"`    | Avoid (though it will work) |
|`booleanField: true`             | OK                          |
|`booleanField: false`            | OK                          |
|`booleanField: 0`                | Avoid (though it will work) |
|`booleanField: 1`                | Avoid (though it will work) |
|`booleanField: yes`              | Avoid (though it will work) |
|`booleanField: no`               | Avoid (though it will work) |

### Lists

YAML Entity Store exports lists without indentation.

The following is an example of how YAML Entity Store writes a YAML file. This is done by tools, such as ES Explorer, when updating or creating and Entity.

```yaml
type: FilterCircuit
fields:
  name: ...
# some other fields
children:
- type: ...
  fields:
    name: ...
    multi:
    - value 1
    - value 2
  children:
  - type: ...
    fields:
# some other stuff
```

The following example is also supported:

```yaml
type: FilterCircuit
fields:
  name: ...
# some other fields
children:
  - type: ...
    fields:
      name: ...
      multi:
        - value 1
        - value 2
    children:
      - type: ...
        fields:
# some other stuff
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}`refs: {}` is an empty list.{{% /alert %}}
