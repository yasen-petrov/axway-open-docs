API Portal updates are cumulative, comprising new features and changes delivered in previous updates unless specifically indicated otherwise in the Release notes.

{{< alert title="Note" >}}
API Portal May 22 update was released in early July

The [API Portal February 22](/docs/apim_relnotes/20220228_apip_relnotes/) update is compatible with the [API Gateway May 2022](/docs/apim_relnotes/20220530_apimgr_relnotes/) update and can be used until the **API Portal May 22** update is available.

## Installation
{{< alert title="Note" >}}
This release of API Portal ships with Joomla 4, which is a major upgrade of the Joomla platform. It is a Joomla perquisite that to upgrade to Joomla 4, you can only upgrade from Joomla 3.10 which is the "bridge" release of Joomla between v3 and v4. If you have previously installations of API Portal you can first upgrade your environment with Joomla 3.10 (no need upgrading API Portal) and then you can apply this update. As a result of this limitation, directly upgrading to API Portal May 2022 (based on with Joomla 4) is only possible from the API Portal Feb 2022 (based on Joomla 3.10) release. 
{{< /alert >}}

API Portal is available as a software installation or a virtualized deployment in a Docker container. For more information, see the following options:

* If you are installing API Portal for the first time using this update, see [Install API Portal](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/).
* If you are already using API Portal (7.5.x, 7.6.x, 7.7.x) and want to install this update, see [Upgrade API Portal](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/upgrade_automatic/). Upgrade to API Portal May 22 is only possible if you have previously installed API Portal 7.7 February 2022 release.
* You can use the [cumulative upgrade script](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/upgrade_automatic/#upgrade-api-portal-using-the-cumulative-upgrade-script) to upgrade directly from earlier versions (for example, 7.5.5, 7.6.2) to API Portal [7.7 November](/docs/apim_relnotes/20201130_apip_relnotes/), then you need to apply API Portal 7.7 February 2022 release, and then you can apply this update package.
* See [API Portal single version upgrade](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/upgrade_automatic/#upgrade-from-api-portal-7-6-2) to upgrade versions incrementally.

| IAP-5043    | 1322729 | **Issue**: WSDL definition download fails when it has references to non-existent xsd-s. **Resolution**: A JAI configuration "Download complete WSDL definition" was added to switch ON/OFF only valid WSDL file to be downloaded.

| IAP-5250    | 1342380 | **Issue**: Multiple unnecessary API calls are executed causing significant performance impact. **Resolution**: Multiple optimizations : 1\. If Elastic is enabled APIs per organization are taken from ES instead of API Manager. 2\. APIs list is fetched only once no matter how many API catalogs are defined. 3. Other small optimizations. |
| IAP-5251    |         | **Issue**: Multiple requests to /discovery/swagger/api/id/{id} API Manager endpoint are made when you open API details page. **Resolution**: Only one request to /discovery/swagger/api/id/{id} API Manager endpoint is made when you open API details page.                                                                                    |

## Known issues

The following are known issues for this update.

### Custom properties permissions per role are not respected in some scenarios

Custom properties permissions per role will not be respected for the organization in the following scenarios:

* Permissions will not be respected for the organization the API is assigned to because respecting them will cause significant performance impact on the Try-it page. The custom properties permissions will follow the role of the user's primary organization.
* On creating an application, the App has no organization yet, so the custom properties permissions cannot be respected per role of the organization. They will follow the permissions for the role of the primary organization of the user.

### When Multi Manager feature is configured, API Portal users are no longer able to login

After a recent bug fix in API Manager (RDAPI-20021), the `Authenticate to Master` policy is no longer working after upgrading from releases earlier than [API Portal July 2020](/docs/apim_relnotes/20200730_apip_relnotes/). To fix this, perform the following steps:

1. Open all slave managers configurations in Policy Studio, and click to **Edit** the `AuthenticateToMaster` policy.
2. Click the **Login to Master** (Connect to URL) filter, and enter `Accept: */*` for the **Request Protocol Header**.
3. Click the **Enter** key twice to create two blank lines after `Accept: */*`.

Alternatively you can take the updated `AuthenticateToMaster` policy and apply again your configurations.

### Page layout and alignment for Arabic language

Changing the API Portal language to Arabic (or any other right to left language) results in issues with page layout and alignment on the API Portal Home and Pricing pages, and some buttons are not visible. As a workaround, you can turn on the development mode in JAI. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to Joomla! Admin Interface (JAI).
2. In the JAI top navigation bar, click **Extensions > Templates**.
3. Click your template style (for example, `purity_III * Default`) to open it.
4. Click the **General** tab.
5. Change **Development Mode** to `ON`.
6. Click **Save** and click **Close** to close the template style.
